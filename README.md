How would this solution work?

1. A set of cards need to be selected / generated
2. An original story needs to be told (Night 1 perhaps)
   - Hopefully this is extremely organic, where each night introduces new content, while testing other content
   - e.g., 2-3 added per night 10-20 tested
3. Some recording mechanism, should report how quickly the child remembered the thing
